    To run this program execute main.py. To test the move generation function pass generate_board a list of strings representing a board and save the output to a variable.
Next pass the variable you just saved into the move_pieces function allong with whos move you want to see, either 'w' or 'b'. This will return a list of new boards. 
To look at the boards you must pass each board into the print board function. The output will be in the terminal.

Update:
    now the program runs oskaplayer in main(). provide it a string for its states and will produce a new string formatted the same as the one that it was given except this one has made the best move possible in the 
    given search space for the specified color. You can print board if you would like with classes.print_board(board), just provide a board object as the parameter.
